# Day-3
In First File i.e. Project TTS.
With the help of python we made a code which convert our provided text in to Audio form.
We also can provide te multiple input to compiler to continously change the text into input.
the code works like ypu have to provide a text to compiler and hit enter and it will convert the text into audio/speech.
if you want to provide multiple inputs.
you just have to type yes and provide the another input.
after writing it will break you out of the code.


In second i.e API Read.
in this we have currency api, which we have to convert and make the data visible in the API.
With the help of python and sone libraries, we read or changed the api's data.
